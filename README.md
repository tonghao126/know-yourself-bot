know-yourself-bot
==============================

Exploration project for fine tuning LLM. I want to create a bot that helps me to know myself better. We'll see how far we can push the envelop :P

Current plan:
- Either:
 1. Experiment with Finetuning using Socrates data see how well the model can assume the way Socrates speaks and ask questions.
 2. Experiment with Rag so I can rely on LLM to give me daily journaling suggestions or ask me questions about myself(llamaindex?)
3. Build a UI using either Gradio or Streamlit or React
