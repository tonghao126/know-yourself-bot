1.  Find dataset on Huggingface Dataset, and potentially look for other sources
    (discussions, results)
2.  Finetuning a small model and start fine tuning (if memory still insufficient, try Lora or Google Collab? [Link to Course](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/finetuning-large-language-models/lesson/8/consideration-on-getting-started-now))
3.  play around with it myself and see how it goes
1. Figure out if possible to incorporate Vervake's stuff from youtube translations
1. See if possible to use transcript along to fine tune base model? (need full retraining?)
